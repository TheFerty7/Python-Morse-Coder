Morse code translator written in Python3.
Currently uses a Node tree to do all of its translating. While it probably isn't the most efficient way to do this, I thought it would be interesting.
If you have an idea of how to improve this in any way, please make a branch and let me know! I'm interested in seeing how someone else would approach this.
